          <h2>iron man of india</h2>
          <p>
            <b>His life has been an inspiring and motivating one.</b> Firstly,
            he achieved his professional goals with very little support from
            others and thereafter playing a major decisive role in bringing the
            people of India together to fight for the nation’s independence. His
            belief in the principle of Unity in Diversity and stand united for
            the common cause of India’s Independence made him the Iron Man of
            India. Due to his leadership qualities and ability to connect to
            masses, he has been given the title of Sardar Patel, meaning leader
            Patel.

          <h2>life after independence</h2>
          <p>
            After Independence, he played a prominent role in the Integration of
            India. He persuaded the rulers of princely states to be united and
            be part of One India – One Nation, by traveling to far-flung areas
            and border areas. Initially, after Independence, he was appointed as
            1st Home Minister of India and simultaneously the Commander in Chief
            of Indian Armed Forces. Later he also became the 1st Deputy Prime
            Minister of India. He is among one of the three leaders who led
            India from 1947 to 1950. Sardar Patel started keeping unwell rapidly
            since the summer of 1950 and Patel died on 15th December 1950 after
            suffering a massive heart attack at Birla House in Bombay, now
            Mumbai in Maharashtra, India.
